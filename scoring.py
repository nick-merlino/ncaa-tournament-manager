scoring.py

This module computes user scores based on tournament results.
It is structured in seven steps:

  1. Base Score Calculation: Fully implemented in calculate_scoring().
  2. Determining the Current Tournament State: Implemented via get_round_game_status() 
     and get_round_game_status_by_region().
  3. Building the Bracket: (Used only for initial seeding.)
  4. (Active set logic removed in favor of dynamic matchups.)
  5. Regional Simulation of Future Rounds: Now builds matchups dynamically from entered games.
  6. Interregional Simulation: Called exactly once after regional simulation.
  7. Final Score Calculation for Future Rounds: Implemented in calculate_worst_case_scores()
     and calculate_best_case_scores().

Logging (prefixed with "[Morey Trace]") is output only if "Morey" appears in the username.
